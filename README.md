Bi-directional LSTM allows looking at particular sequence both from front-to-back as well as from back-to-front. 
This project presents a fake news detection model based on Bi-directional LSTM-recurrent neural network. 

Publicly available news datasets on Kaggle are used to assess the performance of the model:::
